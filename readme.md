# WipeTech Pro - Secure Data Erasure Tool

### **Solving the Problem of Unsecure Data Deletion**

**WipeTech Pro** is a robust, cross-platform data-wiping solution developed during **Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2025**. It addresses the critical security flaw of "soft deletion," where sensitive data remains recoverable on discarded electronic storage media.

Conventional formatting or deletion merely removes the file pointers, leaving the actual data intact on the disk. WipeTech Pro ensures that data is permanently and irrecoverably erased using advanced multi-phase wiping techniques.

## 🛡️ Key Features

  - **Multi-Phase Wiping**: Combines three powerful techniques to ensure zero data recovery:
    1.  **Secure ATA Erase**: Utilizes the drive's built-in firmware commands for a hardware-level wipe.
    2.  **Cryptographic Randomization**: Overwrites the entire storage with random bits to break any remaining data patterns.
    3.  **Metadata Poisoning**: Specifically targets and corrupts the file system metadata (MFT/Inodes).
  - **Cross-Platform Support**: Fully functional on **Windows** (PowerShell/GUI) and **Linux** (Ubuntu/Terminal).
  - **Non-Tamperable Certification**: Generates a secure PDF certificate and a JSON log upon successful completion, featuring a unique hash for verification.
  - **HPA & DCO Detection**: Identifies hidden sectors like Host Protected Areas (HPA) to ensure no data is left in "hidden" drive segments.
  - **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple GUI to select drives and monitor the wiping process in real-time.

## 🚀 How It Works

1.  **Drive Selection**: The tool lists all connected physical drives (HDDs, SSDs, USBs).
2.  **Pre-Checks**: It performs SMART attribute checks and looks for HPA/DCO status.
3.  **Wiping Sequence**: Executes the 3-phase wipe, typically completing a standard SSD wipe in under a minute via firmware integration.
4.  **Verification**: Compares post-wipe metadata against previous states to confirm success.
5.  **Certification**: Issues a signed certificate containing the drive model, serial number, and wipe timestamp.
